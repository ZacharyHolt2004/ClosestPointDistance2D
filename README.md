This project is fairly simple and is meant as an exercise in my understanding of hash tables and hashing applications.

OVERVIEW:
The program processes a large dataset of 1,000,000 coordinate pairs and efficiently finds the two pairs that are the closest, printing the distance between them to the console.

HOW TO USE:
If you wanted to use another file other than the one provided with the project, there are some parameters to follow.
  1. The file must ONLY include pairs of numbers (int or double format) separated by a single space, one pair per line (example below).

  2. To continue to use the config settings included, the file MUST be named "points.txt".
  3. Another filename can be used, it would require the user to manually update the config.
